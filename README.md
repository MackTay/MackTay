I'm currently on the JavaScript journey with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), building my skills and confidence as a developer.

- **Favorite part so far:** Algorithms, data structures, and generally problem solving in projects!
- **Goals:**
  - Complete TOP’s JavaScript curriculum
  - Work on some open-source projects (and my own English teaching site!)
  - Land my first dev job

## A Bit About Me

- I love cycling, exploring new places, and living in Japan
- Open to collaboration and always happy to connect with fellow learners, mentors, and developers!
